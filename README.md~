Implement a simple web application to display a user-entered color. 

There should be two visible items on the page: an input box and a div with a border (so you know it's there even when the color is the same as the page color). The div should show whatever color the user supplies in the input dynamically ("purple", "#0f0", "#fff000", etc.). 

No special handling is required, should the input be invalid. 
Pressing enter in the input box should have no effect. 
The input box should initially prompt the user with something like "Enter a color or code".

Use a modern Javascript MV* library like React, Backbone, Ember, Angular, etc. 
Inline styling and javascript code is fine. 
For page styling, feel free to make things sparse but presentable.
